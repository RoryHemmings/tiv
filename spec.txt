Terminal Image Viewer Spec
############################

The Terminal Image Viewer (TIV) is a more advanced version of the original Console
Image Viewer program. It is designed to run in the linux terminal, however it may well
be cross platform.

The core functionallity of the program takes an image and displays it in the console as
an ascii representation in the terminal. This is achieved by storing a list of characters
that take up increasingly more whitespace in their respective cells, and then mapping
pixels of the image to each of these cells.

The way this can be achieved varies and will include the following modes

Regular 							- just maps pixel intensity to character
Regular w/ shading    - same as regular, but also changes grayscale intensity of character
Regular w/ color 			- same as regular, but also changes color of each character
Block w/ shading			- keeps each character the same (■) but varies shading
Block w/ color				- keeps each character the same (■) but varies color

This program will function as an environment similar vim or emacs where there is a status
bar at the bottom of the screen that displays information. Keyboard shortcuts can be
pressed in order to modify the image being viewed.

The information displayed will include the following:

Image Path
Original Image Dimensions
Scaled Image Dimensions
Horizontal Scalar
Vertical Scalar

Keyboard Shortcuts will also include the following:

Scale the image
Scale the image horizontally
Scale the image vertically

Open a new file
Change the mode
Change the verbosity
